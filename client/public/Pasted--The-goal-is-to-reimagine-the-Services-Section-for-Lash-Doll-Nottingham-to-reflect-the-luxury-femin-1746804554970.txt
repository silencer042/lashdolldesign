The goal is to reimagine the Services Section for Lash Doll Nottingham to reflect the luxury, femininity, and elegance of the salon’s offerings. The updated design will incorporate the full list of services from the provided booking page, including details for lashes, microblading, and facial treatments, while ensuring that the section remains engaging and interactive for users.

1. Services Layout and Structure
Service Categories:

Lashes: Split into categories like Classic Lashes, Volume Lashes, Hybrid Lashes, and Infill Services. Each service should be clearly listed with the service duration and pricing visible.

Microblading: Separate section with the details on the microblading process, pre-care, post-care instructions, and pricing.

Facial Treatments: Include services like Dermaplaning, Microneedling, Glass Skin Facials, and others from the Skincare category.

Anti-Wrinkle Treatments & Fillers: Include services like lip fillers, anti-wrinkle Botox, and non-surgical facial treatments.

Service Cards:

Each service should be displayed in interactive cards with hover effects. When the user hovers over a service, a short description should appear with price and duration.

Add Icons next to each service to visually represent the service (e.g., a lash icon for eyelash services, face icon for facial treatments).

Book Now Button:

Each service card should have a “Book Now” button that directs users to the booking page or opens a modal popup for instant booking.

The CTA buttons should have a soft pink background with rose gold accents, with hover effects that slightly scale the button or change color (e.g., light pink to dark pink).

2. Service Descriptions and Pricing
Service Details:

Each service should have a hover-expand effect that shows more detailed information when clicked (or hovered). Include a description of the service, any before and aftercare instructions, and pricing.

Pricing Breakdown:

Clearly display price ranges for each service (e.g., £50 - £75 for a lash lift depending on the type).

Discounts and Packages: Highlight packages (e.g., Lash + Brow Lamination bundle) with an attractive price point to encourage more bookings.

3. Visual Enhancements for Luxury Appeal
Luxury Background:

Use soft gradients for the background of the services section (e.g., light pink to ivory or pink to gold) for a more elegant look.

Use subtle texture effects in the background like watercolor patterns or lace designs to keep the design feminine and refined.

High-Quality Imagery:

Include high-quality images for each service, including before/after transformations, as well as service-specific images (e.g., close-ups of lashes, microblading, or facial treatments).

Images should be styled with soft lighting to create a luxurious and welcoming atmosphere.

4. Interactive Elements and User Engagement
Hover Animations:

Service Cards: On hover, service cards should gently scale up or change color to encourage clicks. Implement a smooth transition for this effect.

CTA Buttons: Use subtle animations for buttons (e.g., glow effect or slide-in effect on hover) to make them more engaging.

Quick Booking:

Booking Form: The user can select a service directly from this section. When they click “Book Now”, they should be able to select their preferred time and service provider (if applicable) via a pop-up booking modal.

Add to Cart:

Consider adding an option where users can add services to their cart and book multiple services at once, especially for bundled services.

5. Microblading and Brow Services Section
Detailed Information:

For Microblading and Brow Lamination services, include step-by-step information on the procedure, post-care instructions, and contraindications (e.g., who should avoid these services).

This information should expand when clicked to give clients full transparency and help manage expectations.

Pre-care and Post-care Tips:

Create accordion-style expandable sections that offer pre-care and post-care tips for Microblading and other services.

Package Deals:

Offer discounted packages for clients who book both brow and lash services together. Make sure these packages are highlighted with clear CTAs.
