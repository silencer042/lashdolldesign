Design a luxurious, stylish, and feminine website for Lash Doll Nottingham, a premier beauty salon specializing in eyelash extensions, microblading, and lip enhancements. The website must reflect the salon’s high-end, personalized services and elegance, while being highly functional and engaging. The design should include beautiful imagery, interactive elements, and seamless booking options, all while maintaining a consistent pink and soft color palette that exudes sophistication.
